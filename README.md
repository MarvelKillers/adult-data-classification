Income Classification using Random Forest
This project uses a Random Forest classification model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data. The dataset includes demographic and employment-related features such as age, education, occupation, hours worked per week, etc.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Adult Income Dataset. It includes the following columns:

age

workclass

fnlwgt

education

educational-num

marital-status

occupation

relationship

race

gender

capital-gain

capital-loss

hours-per-week

native-country

income (target variable: <=50K or >50K)

🧠 Algorithm
This project implements the Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble machine learning algorithm known for its robustness and accuracy.

⚙️ Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)

Train-test split

Model training using Random Forest

Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)

Feature importance visualization
